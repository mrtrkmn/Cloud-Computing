# Cloud Computing SS22

This repository contains exercises from Cloud Computing course at TUM. 

- Provisioning of instances are done through Terraform and installation of required packages are carried with Ansible. 
- Although exercises do not mention anything about Terraform or Ansible, I included them for easy management and provisioning. 
- All exercises are done in GCP.
