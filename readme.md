# Cloud Computing SS22

This repository contains exercises from Cloud Computing course at TUM. 

Provisioning of instances are done through Terraform and installation of required packages are carried with Ansible. 

Each exercise contains set of simple challenges to overcome. 

Although exercises do not mention anything about Terraform or Ansible, I included them for easy management and provisioning.
